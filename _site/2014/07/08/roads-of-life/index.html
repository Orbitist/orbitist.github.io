		<p>Your GPS is malfunctioning. You smack at the thing in vain. You watch as the last battery bar fades into a black screen as the uncharged GPS is silenced.</p>

<p>Who knew how difficult it was to find a simple dirt road? All you wanted to do today was go on a little adventure. Is that too much to ask?</p>

<p>You hit a pothole. The force of the bump shakes away those preoccupying thoughts for a moment. They’re replaced by the sound of your voice as you complain to your friends, “What is it we pay taxes for, huh? Shouldn’t they have this road all fixed up by now?”</p>

<p>Everyone in the car joins in the chorus of grumbling, all heads nodding in agreeance.</p>

<p>At last, you stumble upon the dirt road you’ve been searching for. Finally your off-roading adventure can begin. Your jeep rushes like the wind through mud and greenery. Your friends answer the singing of birds with hooting and hollering.</p>

<p>You park the jeep in the middle of a clearing and all of you get out of the vehicle to enter a nearby glen where you have the privilege of a first-row seat of nature’s beauty.</p>

<p>One friend takes a photo to upload to Instagram. Another begins to compose a Tweet. Still another goes to post a status update on Facebook. But alas, there is no service at your secluded destination.</p>

<p>So many problems have befallen you on this little outing… #firstworldproblems </p>

<p>But now, on top of it all, you also lack access to social media. If you don’t tweet it, did it actually happen? If you don’t “check in,” were you really there? #lifequestions</p>

<p>As you lay down to go to bed later that night, you think back on the day’s adventure. It was enjoyable enough. Remembering the little speed bumps you hit along the way, you recognize that these things shouldn’t have bothered you as much as they did, and it was these little things that distracted you from appreciating your outing to the fullest extent.</p>

<p>For you and your American friends, the dirt road of your journey held a promise for true adventure. But as you drift to sleep, you’re struck by the realization that dirt roads may be a novelty here, but in other countries, dirt roads are simply the norm.</p>

<p>In the U.S., 100% of roads are paved. Compare that with Brazil who was rocking a percentage of 13.5 in 2010. 33.6% in Venezuela in 2000. 35.4% in Greece in 2010. (*list more countries – but which? random?)</p>

<p>Asphalt is a natural element that occurs in asphalt lakes and rock asphalt, which is a mixture of sand, limestone, and asphalt.</p>

<p>Starting in the late 1860s in the U.S., the first bitumonious mixtures were produced and used for sidewalks, crosswalks, and some roads. Edmund J. DeSmedt, a Belgian chemist, laid the first true asphalt pavement in the United States in front of the City Hall in Newark, New Jersey in 1870. The pavement was modeled after a natural asphalt pavement that had been placed on a French highway in 1852. DeSmedt would go on to pave Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC.</p>

<p>In 1896, New York City replaced brick, granite, and wood block with asphalt paving. Until around 1900, nearly all the asphalt used in the U.S. came from natural sources such as Lake Trinidad and Bermudez Lake in Venezuela. Refined petroleum asphalts had made their appearance in the mid 1870s and gradually gained acceptance. By 1907, refined asphalt had overtaken the use of natural asphalt. As the automobile’s popularity grew, so did the demand for more and better roads. This led to innovations in the production and laying of asphalt. The first central asphalt pavement production facility in the U.S. was opened by the Cummer Company in 1870 and the first asphalt facility to contain almost all of the basic components that facilities have today was built by the the Warren brothers in East Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1901.</p>

<p>In 1939, J.S. Helm, President of the Asphalt Institute is quoted as having said, “Asphalt is an essential material in nearly every form of highway construction and maintenance. In the four years from 1934 to 1937, asphalt entered into the construction of more than four-fifths of the mileage of highways completed in those years under state highway direction.”</p>

<p>Asphalt technology improved at a greater pace during World War II, brought about in part by the need for surfaces that could withstand heavy loads by military aircrafts. After the war, more families moved to the suburbs and road building became a large industry. Congress passed the State Highway Act in 1956, which set aside $51 billion to the states for road construction.</p>

<p>In 1986, the National Asphalt Pavement Association established the National Center for Asphalt Technology at Auburn University in Alabama. This organization provides a centralized systematic approach to asphalt research and is now considered the world’s leading institution for asphalt pavement research today.</p>

<p>Asphalt has a surprisingly long history, which begins thousands of years before the founding of the United States.</p>

<p>The first known recorded use of asphalt for road building was in 625 B.C. Babylon under the reign of King Naboppolassar. Ancient Greeks were also knowledgeable on asphalt and its properties. Our word “asphalt” comes from the Greek word “asphaltos,” which means secure. The Romans would later change the word to “asphaltus,” and used asphalt to seal their baths, reservoirs, and aqueducts.</p>

<p>Centuries later, Europeans discovered natural deposits of asphalt while exploring the New World. For example, in 1595, Sir Walter Raleigh described a “plain,” or lake, of asphalt on the Island of Trinidad, off the coast of Venezuela. He used asphalt to re-caulk his ships.</p>

<p>Several hundred years passed before European builders tried using asphalt to pave roads since a good method of road building was necessary before they could attempt that. John Metcalf of England built 180 miles of Yorkshire roads while insisting on good drainage that required a foundation of large stones covered by excavated road material followed by a layer of gravel. In Scotland from 1803 to 1821, Thomas Telford built more than 900 miles of roads. His contemporary, John Loudon McAdam used broken stone to construct his roads, which later builders bonded together using hot tar, creating a “tarmacadam” pavement that cut down on dust and maintenance.</p>

<p>*need a better transition</p>

<p>Tonight you meet some friends for drinks in the Cobblestone District of downtown Buffalo, NY. As per your current fascination with roads, you pay special attention to the bricks rolling beneath the tires of your car. You wonder why the city decided to return to brick roads in this area instead of the usual asphalt. Your life seems to be revolving around roads lately. The poet in you sees it as a metaphor. Inside the bar, you steer conversation to reflect your latest fixation.</p>

<p>Close by the Cobblestone District is Canalside – another area of Buffalo that is being worked on in order to revitalize the immediate waterfront and overall city. The area is themed around the site’s history and preservationalist Tim Tielman said, “The historic elements are what gives everything around it credence and value… Fads and businesses come and go. History has a generation-to-generation appeal.” Perhaps the historical appeal is the reason behind the new brick roads of the Cobblestone District as well.</p>

<p>You note the interesting cycle of things. How what was old became new again. How in laying down new bricks, Buffalo is building a future while also going back to its roots. How it’s pretty neat that we have the luxury of re-doing our roads just to achieve a sense of nostalgia and build up the urban tourism of an area by appealing to its history.</p>

<p>On your way home, you choose the alternate route offered by your GPS – resisting the thruway, you take side streets. As you drive down one old side street, you notice a spot where the asphalt is naturally wearing away to reveal the brick road that once was. For some reason, this really resonates with you.</p>

<p>Most paved roads are made from asphalt concrete which consists of bitumen and mineral aggregate. But this material has already began to be replaced by environmentally-friendly, organic resin-based roads like Eco-Pave. Other road manufacturing companies are currently investigating the use of recycled plastics in road construction. The roads giving society its stability really has no stability of its own. Just like everything else on the road of life, road materials are constantly in flux.</p>

<p>The world is covered by 20,767,047.3 miles of roads, which is enough road to travel over halfway to Mars.</p>

<p>You see these roads as evidence of human existence. The roads serve as humanity’s roots and a marker of where we are headed simultaneously. Eventually the roads wear away and we see what had once been. Where we were versus where we are going. You wonder what the future will see. What kind of road map we are creating.</p>

<p>Roads built today are engineered to fulfill a variety of needs including those of less noise, improved durability, enhanced skid resistance, less splash and spray in rain, and an overall smoother ride. The first asphalt laid in Newark 130 years ago bears little resemblance to the asphalt superhighways of today. With the continued efforts for constant progress in road technology, it may not be long until we, too, look back on our roads to notice the change that will doubtlessly persist over the coming years.</p>

<p>In the Netherlands exists a road that seems to be from that of a sci-fi flick set in the future. This 500 meter stretch of highway has been upgraded with light-absorbing glow-in-the-dark paint that elimates the need for streetlights.</p>

<p>These glow-in-the-dark road markings were trialled in Brabant, Netherlands along with other new road technologies including dynamic paint and wireless electric vehicle charging. Dynamic paint allows for symbols to appear on the road surface to indicate whether temperature is in a range that would affect driving conditions. Wireless electric vehicle charging is expected in 2018 and would end the need for electric cars to stop and refuel ever again by using “inductive power transfer” to charge them wirelessly as they travel along the road. </p>

<p>Trialled in Crandon, Wisconsin, anti-icing roads contain naturally reactive de-icer that prevents ice from forming on roads. Currently in development are solar energy roads which are being trialled in Sandpoint, Idaho. These roads would be specially-toughened and durable solar panels that would help to provide alternative means of power generation.</p>

<p>Not only are road technologies improving, but so is automobile technology. Automakers and technology firms are headed in the direction of driverless cars – working on building autonomous vehicles for the road of the future. As for today, that is not yet the case.</p>

<p>Tonight you shut off your GPS and navigate the roads to find your way home all on your own. You roll down your window and appreciate each new rush of wind at every turn. You don’t even so much as grimace when you hit a slight bump here and there. You notice each fracture and stretch of smoothness in the road, but see it all as what gives the road character. Wide-eyed and newly aware of your surroundings, you drive. All the while enjoying the ride.</p>
