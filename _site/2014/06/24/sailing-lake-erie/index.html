		<p>Sitting silently in his 25-foot sailboat, reading the day’s <em>Buffalo News</em>, Robert Coles had little to do other than soak up the sun’s rays following a brief, heavy rainfall from an hour earlier. Easy to miss him from a cursory glance across the RCR Yachts marina <i onclick="map.setView( [42.870174,-78.877876], 16, { animate: true, duration: 0.25, easeLinearity: 0.25 });" class="fa fa-globe btn btn-success btn-sm changeview"></i>
, amongst the other boats covered by shadows of old grain elevator buildings.</p>

<p>The rain clouds had moved east to let out the late afternoon, August sun over Western New York. Light reflected off the one empty beer can next to Coles, who was dressed for a day on the water: button down shirt, light brown fedora and khaki pants. But he could only appreciate the steady breeze from the dock as it passed by his sail guidelines.</p>

<p>Of all things to stop a wind-powered craft, his engine was broken. </p>

<p>“The exhaust, which naturally goes out that end,” he said, pointing to the back of the boat, “ended up going into my cabin, which meant carbon monoxide.”</p>

<p><img src="http://orbitist.s3.amazonaws.com/2014/06-sail-lake-eire/images/IMG_0298.jpg" /></p>

<p>Almost six weeks had passed since he was able to take his boat, <em>Moorjoy II</em>, into the wide-open Lake Erie. It was not the first time he had difficulty with the boat, and he recounted long past stories he considered growing pains of learning to sail. So the 82-year-old, who still manages his Buffalo architectural firm when not sailing, visited his boat daily to inspect the repairs and relax with a cold beer on the water.</p>

<p><strong>He’s not alone.</strong></p>

<p>“Some come down in the middle of winter” Rick Lenard, a sales broker at RCR Yahcts, said. “A nice January day, it might be 30 degrees out, they go (into their cabins)…read a book, do work. Sailing is a lifestyle.”</p>

  <dd>proper development; bringing more tourists; incorporating past into future. But beyond that front is an open and moving landscape for a group of people - many who seem quite happy with what is available -to go out and have fun, or compete, or relax. It has been that way for years and several see improvements.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Ed Quinlan, 63, spends his time fixing boats and training people at Seven Seas Sailing School. For much of his youth he was out on Lake Erie learning to sail, traveling with friends for daily excursions to wherever possible. He grew up in Hamburg and stayed until the 70’s, choosing to leave because of the very water he sailed.</p>

<p>“I didn’t like the dirty water,” he said, providing an unpleasant description of the region’s beaches during that time, with dead fish and oily seaweed on shore and rats scampering across the land. Going for a swim meant coming out covered in some “black, gooey stuff.”</p>

<p>“It was water, but it wasn’t all water.”</p>

<p><img src="http://orbitist.s3.amazonaws.com/2014/06-sail-lake-eire/images/IMG_0332.jpg" /></p>

<p>So Quinlan spent 33 years in Hawaii, enjoying clear ocean waters and good winds. He bought his own boat and also became a mate on an ocean racer, earning many sailing and boating certificates along the way. It became his lifestyle in almost every aspect. Even the worst experiences or troubling situations became good memories.</p>

<p>“In sailing, the destination is the journey,” Quinlan said in a wax lyrical manner. “Hardly any boats have a destination in mind, but every minute of the journey, you’re involved. The silence. The wind working with the water. Best way to spend your time.”</p>

<p>It was two and a half years ago he chose to come back to a clean lake, following the “demise of industry and unintentional introduction of the zebra muscle.”</p>

<p>Lack of industry regulations over 40-years ago were part of the problem, when chemicals, such as phosphates, easily leached into the water from large factory outflows, Lenard said. He has kept an eye on waterfront development and changes over the years from his office underneath Route 5 skyway and overlooking the outer harbor. Conditions are better now, he feels.</p>

<p>“On calm days, you go out to Bethlehem Steel, you can see the bottom 20 feet of water,” which has its negatives, he added. “When it is so clear and calm, on hot summer days, you have more algae growth and seaweed… so it can be good and bad. It’s cyclical.”</p>

<p>But the constant breezes and warm summers, like the one that just passed with many days in the upper 80 degree temperature range, create a favorable environment for anyone with a sailboat, even racing out on the water.</p>

<p>Look out on the water some Wednesday night, when over 80 different styles and sizes of boats and captains meet past the break-walls near Erie Basin Marina. Out there they challenge each other through a several mile course, which changes based on weather conditions, and winds its way back to the stone walls to end.</p>

<p>The races are managed by the Buffalo Harbor Sailing Club, a 40-year-old club that began with “two guys and some testosterone,” Lenard noted. Year-round the organization works to plan functions, regattas and meetings, with a focus on education.</p>

<p>Aboard many of the boats are crew members looking to learn the nuances a sailor needs to survive. Someone with a little knowledge, either from past experience or recently out of a local training school, has the chance to hop on a boat and discover what it takes to pilot the craft.</p>

<p>The club has even expanded its options to include Tuesday night sails, when there are other styles of races, including a specific category to introduce more women into the sport by demanding a predominantly female crew with a woman skipper.</p>

<p>“There are a lot of tactics involved. It is teamwork, and that is one of the things sailboat racing teaches,” Lenard said.</p>

<p><em><strong>Buffalo Racing </strong></em></p>

<p>On one such evening in late July, Jack Kitrenos was preparing his 41-foot boat, <em>Slider</em>, for a Wednesday night race. The boat is 9,500 pounds when empty, has a 70-foot black mast rising above all the other masts in Erie Basin Marina, and can hold about 14 crew members.</p>

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/eZNCGxDm9BE?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>“It’s built for speed, not for comfort, it’s built for speed,” Kitrenos said before the race in his boat.</p>

<p><img src="http://orbitist.s3.amazonaws.com/2014/06-sail-lake-eire/images/IMG_0247.jpg" /></p>

<p>He takes the races seriously, to a point. He has one of the faster boats on the water, he said, though he could name a few other boat styles and their skippers that cruise Lake Erie that are just as quick, or better. Despite wanting to win, his time out is relaxing, a way to build camaraderie - a word used by many in the sailing club - among the all volunteer crew who help him manage Slider through the waves.</p>

<p>“Everyone has a job… they all swear at the skipper,” Kitrenos said, laughing with some of the crew members who arrived early. Many have raced together for a long time and know each other well. It seemed that as long as Kitrenos continued supplying the beer, they would provide the muscle. “It’s all good.”</p>

<p>Wind conditions that evening worried him, and without the power to alter the flow, Kitrenos continuously examined wind readings so he knew the type of sails to carry and the best approach for the starting line. Stronger, heavier winds were not good for his boat - it preferred “light air,” - and at 12 knots he said he was right on the line. Weather is everything for a sailboat, and the elements can change quickly.</p>

<p>“The wind doesn’t always come out of the same direction all the time. It’s always moving around,” Kitrenos stated on his boat.</p>

<p><em><strong>Training and Learning</strong></em></p>

<p>That “always moving” caught him off guard once while in Cleveland where he “wiped out” <em>Slider</em>. The gust knocked the boat onto its side, left the keel hanging out of the water, caused him to hang onto a guideline with nothing but water below him, and no control of the boat.</p>

<p>“My bowman actually went off the boat. He was in the water and we grabbed him by the collar as he was going by,” he said. “It caused $28,000 in damage.”</p>

<p>That is an extreme learning moment. When Coles first started sailing 45 years ago, the boat’s previous owner provided makeshift lessons, only going out three times before leaving Coles on his own.</p>

<p>Following the third time out, Coles said he “made every mistake in the book,” and at one point he met up with the Erie County Sheriff’s department as they pulled his boat out of the water after he tipped it over in the harbor. He laughed heartily at those memories.</p>

<p>“I pretty much became an expert over the years. Just by making mistakes. You learn by doing in sailing,” he said.</p>

<p>There are several training schools in the region that help teach people how to avoid, or recover, from such problems, and provide an actual experience beyond reading descriptions or looking at pictures. As an instructor, Quinlan advocated people take that route and learn from his mistakes.</p>

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Wm0x1oLv0OI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>“Respect the ocean,” seemed to be his maxim when teaching. “The water is not our environment. People do a lot better on land.”</p>

<p><img src="http://orbitist.s3.amazonaws.com/2014/06-sail-lake-eire/images/IMG_0244.jpg" /></p>

<p>Beyond that, he teaches the terms used while sailing; what each line, rope and beam do; how to obtain perfect sail trim and then catch the most wind. There is also the one thing that still causes him to marvel, even after sailing on the Pacific and Indian oceans, even after an estimated 10,000 sailing outings, he continues to feel wonder at sailing up into the wind.</p>

<p>“Every time I go out, I’m just amazed at the magic of how a sailboat sails upwind,” Quinlan said, calling it exhilarating to go around seven knots into the wind on a big sailboat. “It defies logic, until you study it. There’s physics involved, and that’s how we do it,” and he paused briefly before adding “it does it whether you understand it our not.”</p>

<p>Unless using a motor, a sailboat cannot make its way directly into a breeze, but it can travel upwind. A very basic premise is the boat will head 45 degrees left or right of a headwind, catching the air along one side of the sail. To continue moving upwind, the skipper will turn the boat in a motion called “tacking” so the wind strikes the opposite side of the sail. Then, repeat as necessary.</p>

<p>“They say sailing is a sport that takes 10 minutes to learn and a lifetime to perfect, and that’s absolutely true,” Quinlan said.</p>

<p>Once basics are learned, Lake Erie is the place for a lifetime of learning experiences. A simple pleasure cruise is always an option, or there are the races, which, despite the wide-open water, create frantic moments as boats align themselves at the start.</p>

<p>During that July race night for Kitrenos, some 70 hulls with cloth sails darted about, waiting for starting sirens to sound from Bob Ihrig’s power boat, <em>Commune</em>, a “waterfront condo” with a comfy interior and lower level bedroom. His boat and a distant buoy created an imaginary line boats cross to start each race.</p>

<p>There were no collisions at the race start that night, but many close calls. Boats, relying on wind power and a captain’s knowledge at that point, crept within inches of other hulls, floating traffic jams with no way to stop. A wave bouncing one way while the wind pushed another could cause a serious accident or argument. Sometimes a loud voice was all the warning others had.</p>

<p>“Obstruction! Obstruction! He’s creating an obstruction!” one sailor screamed as a boat in front seemed to squeeze past, or may have just blocked the way for him to obtain a good start.</p>

<p>“This is the exciting part…oh dear,” Suzzane Lewis, a volunteer on the <em>Commune</em>, said as another boat almost scraped by the back portion of the boat and near to where she sat.</p>

<p>It was considered a good race with few problems or complaints. And Kitrenos had the wind’s favor, light and easy throughout. Watching his boat cross the finish line was far from monumental: on calm waters it floated past the end at a constant speed. But it was 26 minutes ahead of the nearest competition: a combination of a good boat, a lot of knowledge and favorable weather.</p>

<p><em><strong>Simple Pleasures</strong></em></p>

<p>Racing is an extreme way to test one’s talents and ability to work with others while on the water. Coles had little interest in those types of challenges, finding more than enough joy  touring the water as an urban sailor “with Buffalo’s architecture as a backdrop. It’s where I dream about what the city can be,” he wrote in an article for <em>Artvoice</em> back in 2000.</p>

<p>It remains true in the present day, but for now he is trying to get his boat in top form. When talking about the boat’s issues, he hardly seemed upset, simply resigned it would cost money to fix, hoping it would be soon. And with rain gear in hand he showed for his daily visit, to inspect and relax.</p>

<p>Avoiding races and large crews, Coles kept things simple. After he provided the obligatory boat description all boat owners go through - stating mast height and hull size - Coles pointed out he is normally a one man crew.</p>

<p>“I sail this by myself,” he declared, and when asked if he brings others out, he chuckled and said “as infrequently as possible. My wife comes out once a year. I suppose you could say I’m a loner and all, and I suppose that is true.”</p>

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/acPNehzpKLM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>A loner on the water, he is someone long involved with the region, and has the stories to accompany each year: working at Bethlehem Steel for several summers as a youth; attending Massachusetts Institute of Technology to become an architect; coming back to Buffalo for a job and “thinking I would only be here for three months and all, but three months is gone for 50 years,” and working on the public committee to help design Erie Basin Marina in 1964.</p>

<p>From then until now he learned to sail, and to do it with his own hands. He has some difficulty raising the main sail at his age, and exiting the boat onto the narrow dock is done with care, but Coles said he tries to raise the sails on the lake at least every other day.</p>

<p>“I said I could do this,” when he first started cruising the waters in 1963. Years later he sees “no notion that it is difficult by myself.”</p>

<p>Behind Coles was a four-person training class from Seven Seas that had donned life preservers and listened as their instructor went over safety and gave out orders for loosening the ropes before the late evening class started.</p>

<p>Other boat crews were preparing for the race, loosening sails as they backed away from slips and motored past the 10-story Great Northern grain elevator industrial site, going northwest to enter the lake and raise their wind catchers.</p>

<p>“I miss the solitude of being out there and all. I sort of recognized that I wouldn’t be sailing for a little while, and I’m okay with that,” he said as his disabled boat drifted back and forth within the slip. “Sailing is a wonderful way to become independent. And to keep your independence.”</p>
