					<h2>Intro</h2>
					<h4><small>by Wendy Straight</small></h4>
					<p class="lead">An introduction to this research project.</p>
					<p>When conducting research into Chautauqua County’s Underground Railroad and America’s anti-slavery movement, one does not look for mythical tunnels, hidden rooms, or rings of trees.  Instead, the work is centered upon the people involved– most of them native New Englanders and free African Americans. Together they built a vast and well populated network of activists, some working publically (above ground) and others behind the scenes (the “underground”). Some did both.</p>

<p>One major source for such research is the collection of Judge Elial T. Foote’s historical papers (<a href="http://www.mcclurgmuseum.org/collection/archives/elial_t_foote_papers/elial_t_foote_papers.html">the Foote papers</a>). Although he lived in Chautauqua County for a very short time, he was a major player in the anti-slavery movement, and he kept lists of and correspondence from his colleagues in this county and elsewhere. </p>

<p>Another source is the contributions list of Underground Railroad conductor Benjamin Vincent, who kept a file of his neighbors who had donated clothing for refugees.</p>

<p>Yet another source is the memoir of Underground Railroad conductor Eber Pettit, who named some nearby conductors and stationmasters. </p>

<p>Still another source is a list of officers and committee leaders at local meetings of the anti-slavery society. </p>

<p>The mission of this database is to place these people on the map, attempting to comprehend and honor their work. It is especially rewarding to find names that appear in more than one of the primary sources. An example is Benjamin Vincent himself, who also appears in the <a href="http://www.mcclurgmuseum.org/collection/archives/elial_t_foote_papers/elial_t_foote_papers.html">Foote papers</a>. Other examples are Rev. A. P. Hawley, Rev. S. G. Orton, C. O. Matthews, Thomas Danforth, Havens Brigham, and Abner Hazeltine, who all appear not only in the <a href="http://www.mcclurgmuseum.org/collection/archives/elial_t_foote_papers/elial_t_foote_papers.html">Foote papers</a>, but also in the published minutes of the county anti-slavery meeting of 1839.</p>

					<h2>Four refugees</h2>
					<h4><small>by Douglas H. Shepard</small></h4>
					<p class="lead">A synopsis of two stories</p>
					<p>The determination of the Underground Railroad (UGRR) operatives in western New York was greatly intensified by the plight of four refugees in particular: Joseph, Mary, and James Norton about 1844, and Harrison Williams in 1851. Furthermore, while the Norton case appears to have been an example of abolitionists taunting slaveholders, the Williams case was a clear example of slaveholders’ retribution.</p>

<p>Joseph Norton’s escape was relatively painless for him, but Mary Norton and Harrison Williams were made to suffer greatly for their attempts to flee bondage. Fortunately, the records suggest that all four persons finally enjoyed freedom.</p>

					<h2>Purchased freedom</h2>
					<h4><small>by Douglas H. Shepard</small></h4>
					<p class="lead">The story of Joseph Mary and James Norton</p>
					<p>Joseph (Jo) Norton was a refugee from slavery in the mid-1840s. He lived, worked, and studied in various places in New York State. A group of abolitionists in Chautauqua County and Cattaraugus County were instrumental in helping Norton to purchase the freedom of his wife Mary and son James, who had been forced to remain in slavery for more than a year after his escape.</p>

<p>One of Norton’s benefactors in both counties was Eber M. Pettit, who ran a UGRR station in Versailles (Cattaraugus County) NY, and whose father James Pettit ran a UGRR station in Fredonia (Chautauqua County) NY. Many years after the events occurred, Pettit wrote about Norton’s escape as part of a series of 1867 articles in the Fredonia (NY) Censor, which were published in an 1879 book. Correspondence found in the <a href="http://www.mcclurgmuseum.org/collection/archives/elial_t_foote_papers/elial_t_foote_papers.html">Foote papers</a>, the anti-slavery collection of Judge Elial T. Foote, verifies most of Pettit’s account of the purchase of freedom for Mary and James.</p>

<p>Pettit said Norton’s escape from the District of Columbia (DC) also included two other men and two women. Pettit indicated that at least Norton had been encouraged to escape by an unnamed northerner. The entire party may have been slaves of Norton’s master, “Colonel Hardy, a tobacco planter residing in the District, about five miles from the city.” Although Pettit gave the year as 1839, it was most likely 1843. The Colonel’s intensive search for the party was abandoned almost immediately, because within a few days of the escape, he received an anonymous letter containing a clipping or reprint from the <em>Liberty Press</em> in Albany NY.</p>

<p>The Albany article reported that the five refugees had arrived there “by the quickest passage on record.” The article also gave details that only Colonel Hardy’s slaves would have known. However, Pettit explained, the Albany article was a ruse, perpetrated by UGRR operatives. In reality, the five escapees were still in hiding in the Baltimore area. Pettit said, “The plan adopted by the enterprising managers of the UGRR to mislead the owners of the fugitives, and induce them to give up the chase, was kept secret a long time, and great numbers escaped thereby without capture or accident between the Capitol city of the Nation to that of our own State.”</p>

<p>According to Pettit, Norton and the other four people had arrived at a cemetery in the northeast corner of DC on the appointed hour of the evening of an appointed date. In fact, the cemetery may be seen on the map of the City of Washington published by Thomas, Cowperthwaite &amp; Co., Philadelphia, 1850. (Illustration 1.) Although each had been told that there would be others in the party, none knew precisely who the others would be. Upon a pre-planned signal, all came out from hiding in the cemetery, and were instructed to follow the turnpike to the railway, and then to follow the tracks until another conductor intercepted them and gave another pre-arranged signal.</p>

<p>According to Pettit, the trek from the cemetery to the meeting with the second conductor was a trip of 30 miles that took place on foot during a single night. The exhausted refugees were taken to a secluded corn field where they were allowed to sleep for the day. At dark, the two women were led to a carriage and driven away. The men continued to hide until they were assured by their guide that the Colonel’s search had been abandoned.</p>

<p>The men then made their way on foot through Baltimore, guided by a young boy who posed as their friend or relative. According to Pettit, the boy instructed the three refugees to stop and buy apples and peanuts, and to talk loudly about the “religious meeting” they had supposedly just attended. On the northern outskirts of Baltimore, the three men rejoined the two women, and the party began the next leg of the journey. Traveling on foot at night and “stopping through the day at farm houses with Quakers,” Norton and his party reached Philadelphia, where they were placed on a fishing boat to reach Bordentown NJ.</p>

<p>They were next placed on an actual train to Albany, the two women dressed in finery and veils and accompanied by a UGRR operative who posed as a brusque and pompous southerner, Pettit said. Norton and the other two men were hidden in freight cars. In Albany, Norton expected to meet his wife and son, who were to have escaped by a different route. However, Pettit said, Norton was told that Mary’s owner, whose name was recorded simply as Judson, had suspected her plans to flee, and had thrown her into prison until she could be sold “to be sent to the rice swamps, the worst punishment that could be inflicted upon a slave.”</p>

<p>Mary had been pregnant with her second child, but lost the baby in prison. Judson relented in time to save Mary’s life, and she was released back to his custody. About a year after Norton’s own escape, he learned that his wife and son were still alive and were still with Judson.</p>

<p>Norton had traveled west from Albany, eventually arriving at Pettit’s UGRR station in Versailles, where Norton worked, most likely on the farms of Pettit’s son-in-law D. R. Barker, who lived at the same station. Norton also attended a small school to learn to read and write. At Pettit’s suggestion, he and Norton wrote to friends and colleagues in the anti-slavery community, to inquire about Mary and James, and to propose the purchase of their freedom. Five pieces of this correspondence may be found in the <a href="http://www.mcclurgmuseum.org/collection/archives/elial_t_foote_papers/elial_t_foote_papers.html">Foote papers</a>.</p>

<p>First, there is a letter of 25 January 1845, in which Pettit explained to Foote that the well known abolitionist William L. Chaplin had drawn up a contract with Judson that would free Mary. In that letter, Pettit said that he and Norton were making every attempt to raise the required $300.  Second, on the same sheet of paper in the same handwriting is a note from Norton to Foote, requesting a loan and promising to pay it back.</p>

<p>Third, there is a letter to Foote dated 6 February 1845 and signed by Pettit, B. Chamberlain, H. Colman, and E. S. Colman. The letter explains that Norton and Pettit already have $100 and will raise another $100 in Cattaraugus County. It goes on to request that Foote and his Chautauqua County colleagues raise the additional $100. Fourth, there is Foote’s reply, co-signed by N. A. Lowry, and pledging to raise the $100 in Chautauqua County. The fourth and fifth letters both refer to Asher Tyler, who was most likely advancing the money to Judson in DC. Pettit later stated in his memoir that T. R. Colman, who was not only a banker but also a business colleague of Tyler and a brother of H. Colman and E. S. Colman, had raced through a blinding snow storm to Buffalo, in order to wire funds to DC.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a fifth letter in the <a href="http://www.mcclurgmuseum.org/collection/archives/elial_t_foote_papers/elial_t_foote_papers.html">Foote papers</a> pertaining to Norton. It is Pettit’s 25 April 1845 letter to Foote, reporting that Chaplin had arrived in Utica with Mary and James, and that Norton was racing there to join them. Norton had already reimbursed his benefactors all but $37.35.</p>

<p>According to Pettit, the Norton family settled in Syracuse and enjoyed a comfortable living there until late in 1851, when Norton participated in the “Jerry Rescue,” an attempt to free another refugee who was about to be sent back to slavery under the Fugitive Slave Law. In the melee, Pettit said, Norton struck a marshal with a crow bar, breaking his arm. At that point, Norton decided that he and his family would be safer in Canada. Pettit said, “He settled in Toronto, where he was respected as a citizen, and took a great interest in the education of his family, and in promoting the best interests of fugitives who were constantly arriving there.”</p>

					<h2>Harrison Williams</h2>
					<h4><small>by Douglas H. Shepard</small></h4>
					
					<p>In October 1851, slave catchers appeared in southern Chautauqua County, recaptured the 19-year-old refugee Harrison Williams (also known as William Harrison and William Henry Harrison), transported him to court in Buffalo, and then returned him to slavery.</p>

<p>On the 12th or 13th of January in 1851, Williams had escaped from his owner Dr. N. D. Parran (also spelled Perren, Perrin, and Parron) in Hardy County, VA. Williams eventually found refuge at the farm of William Storum, a free African American who lived with his family in the Town of Busti, south of Jamestown near the Pennsylvania State Line.</p>

<p>It was on the morning of September 30 that the southerners kidnapped Williams from the Storum farm and rushed him to Buffalo. The trial was in Federal court the next day. By October 2, Williams was on a train heading back to slavery in Virginia under the custody of a U.S. Marshal.</p>

<p>The story of the trial appeared in the New York Times (Illustration 2) and in the Buffalo Commercial Advertiser on October 2, and follow-ups appeared in the Buffalo Daily Courier, the Buffalo Morning Express, and the Jamestown Journal on October 3. The Buffalo accounts differed slightly from one another, depending upon whether or not the paper’s editor was an anti-slavery man. The Commercial Advertiser and the Buffalo Morning Express were sympathetic toward Williams; the Buffalo Daily Courier was sympathetic toward the court.</p>

<p>There are differences among the other accounts as well. For example, the Jamestown account said that Williams had been working in southern Chautauqua County for the African American farmer Lewis (or Nevis) Clark(e), a relative of Storum.</p>

<p>Once Williams was returned to slavery, there was no word from him until the Jamestown News of February 12, 1864 reported that Sergeant J. W. Broadhead of Busti had encountered Williams during the Civil War. Williams told Broadhead that Parran had sent him to New Orleans to be sold, and that from there, he had been sold a second time into northern Georgia. There he was taken into the “rebel army” as an officer’s servant, but escaped “into the Union lines” and became a servant to officers there.</p>

<p>Forty years after his escape and recapture, William’s story appeared again in the Jamestown Saturday Times  of July 18, 1891, where the writer Palmer K. Shankland revealed the names of abolitionists who tried to save Williams from his return to slavery. Among those who attempted to block the recapture were Levi Jones, Lewis Clark(e), Marinda Storum, and Henry Storum.</p>

<p>Among those who attempted to rescue Williams from his captors were Jabez Broadhead and Norman Backus, who followed Williams’ captors to Jamestown. There, Broadhead and Backus enlisted the help of Silas Shearman, Judge Hazeltine, and Frank Palmer, and they sent a telegraph to Dunkirk’s George French, who lived on Lake Erie in northern Chautauqua County.</p>

<p>According to Shankland, Shearman sped toward Dunkirk and was given fresh horses by Milton Smith in Stockton NY. Shearman changed horses again in Dunkirk and continued on toward Buffalo. Meanwhile, Humphrey Pratt, another abolitionist from southern Chautauqua County and northern Pennsylvania was also on his way to Buffalo. Since French had telegraphed abolitionist friends in Buffalo, the court was reputedly filled with angry onlookers, who to no avail protested Williams’ recapture.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Shankland said, efforts were underway back in the Town of Busti to secure the safety of the other six men who had been in Williams’ party of refugees. They were sheltered by John Broadhead, Thomas Danforth, Theron Plumb, and then next concealed by Dr. Catlin in Sugar Grove, PA and by other abolitionists in northern Pennsylvania before being “quietly passed along the ‘underground railway’ to Canada.”</p>

<p>However, shortly after Shankland’s article appeared in the Jamestown Saturday Times, a long-awaited, eye-witness account appeared. It was found in the Jamestown Journal, and in the Warren, PA Ledger of August 7, 1891. It seems to have been submitted in care of Warren resident A. H. McKelvey. It was signed by “A Sugar Grove Correspondent,” who wrote, “Although I was young at the time, I remember the kidnapping of Harrison very well. But what facts I write in this case I have received from conversing with those who are still living and were intimately connected with the construction and equipment of the underground railroad of forty years ago.</p>

<p>“The seven runaway slaves all bore fictitious names. We knew the boy who was kidnapped as William Henry Harrison, instead of Harrison Williams. The mother of Henry Storum was the woman who tried to help Harrison make his escape, and Marinda, a sister of Henry’s, pushed the gun aside when Henry attempted to shoot and disable the horses of the kidnapping party.</p>

<p>“Loren Blodgett [son of Arba Blodgett], another person who was an active Abolitionist, notified Humphrey Pratt at once, and they rode on horseback in hot pursuit to Jamestown, the latter riding Prince, a colt of the noted Falconer Durac. Prince received a permanent injury in this race, but lived to the great age of about 30 years. Pratt, instead of going to Buffalo as stated, took the Randolph road, to meet his son and Billy McCoo, another slave, whom he had sent there on business, and thought perhaps they might meet and have trouble with the kidnappers, who it was thought by some would go via Salamanca. It was afterwards learned they were making for Buffalo, where the only U.S. Marshal in this section was stationed. Billy McCoo was in Jamestown and saw Dr. Perrin, Harrison’s master, riding with the kidnapping party, and hastened with the other slaves (who were there attending a circus) to the Marvin swamp, where they remained until after dark, and then made their way to friends [in] Sugar Grove.</p>

<p>“Lewis Clark, better known in the play of ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ as Geo. Harris, was a noted Abolition lecturer, a slave, and brother-in-law of Henry Storum. He was censured unjustly at the time by pro-slavery men for cowardice in not helping to save Harrison, but as soon as he could get his arms in condition he mounted his horse and followed the slave-holders, and was sitting on his horse in Jamestown exciting the people to action, when Pratt and Blodgett arrived in the city. The late Heaman Wodard, then a young boat hand on Lake Erie, happened to be in Buffalo and helped to organize a mob to release Harrison, but the officers, knowing they were protected by the fugitive slave law, were encouraged to help return Harrison to his Virginia master. Two of the seven slaves had previously returned to Virginia against the wishes of their comrades to help their wives escape, and it was afterwards learned that they were captured and whipped until they confessed where Harrison and the others were located.</p>

<p>“The other four slaves were concealed on Lanning Hill, then owned by Seth McDaniels, for several days, and fed by their friends. Those who saw them said they were well fortified on the hay mow with clubs and stones, and meant to fight to a finish. When they decided to make their way toward the north star, Mrs. Pratt cooked them a midnight meal, and sent them on their way rejoicing. They went to Beaver Dam, Pa., were secreted by a wealthy farmer—William Gray—who delivered them on a boat at Erie, which landed them safely in Canada.”</p>
