<p>When conducting research into Chautauqua County’s Underground Railroad and America’s anti-slavery movement, one does not look for mythical tunnels, hidden rooms, or rings of trees.  Instead, the work is centered upon the people involved– most of them native New Englanders and free African Americans. Together they built a vast and well populated network of activists, some working publically (above ground) and others behind the scenes (the “underground”). Some did both.</p>

<p>One major source for such research is the collection of Judge Elial T. Foote’s historical papers (<a href="http://www.mcclurgmuseum.org/collection/archives/elial_t_foote_papers/elial_t_foote_papers.html">the Foote papers</a>). Although he lived in Chautauqua County for a very short time, he was a major player in the anti-slavery movement, and he kept lists of and correspondence from his colleagues in this county and elsewhere. </p>

<p>Another source is the contributions list of Underground Railroad conductor Benjamin Vincent, who kept a file of his neighbors who had donated clothing for refugees.</p>

<p>Yet another source is the memoir of Underground Railroad conductor Eber Pettit, who named some nearby conductors and stationmasters. </p>

<p>Still another source is a list of officers and committee leaders at local meetings of the anti-slavery society. </p>

<p>The mission of this database is to place these people on the map, attempting to comprehend and honor their work. It is especially rewarding to find names that appear in more than one of the primary sources. An example is Benjamin Vincent himself, who also appears in the <a href="http://www.mcclurgmuseum.org/collection/archives/elial_t_foote_papers/elial_t_foote_papers.html">Foote papers</a>. Other examples are Rev. A. P. Hawley, Rev. S. G. Orton, C. O. Matthews, Thomas Danforth, Havens Brigham, and Abner Hazeltine, who all appear not only in the <a href="http://www.mcclurgmuseum.org/collection/archives/elial_t_foote_papers/elial_t_foote_papers.html">Foote papers</a>, but also in the published minutes of the county anti-slavery meeting of 1839.</p>
