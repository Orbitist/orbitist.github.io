A short month ago I turned 30. For me it is a number after 29 and before 31 and means I listened to my parents and looked both ways before crossing the highway. Why should I place such an importance on an age so many others have reached? Looking at my ancestry, I've only lived a third of my life, if I'm lucky and reasonably smart.

But for the Arctic Tern, the end is near if it has not already ended. Researchers (link) give it a 30-year lifespan on this planet. From hatching on the shores of (WHERE?) to its migration patterns across the Atlantic, it has 30 years to live its life.

Which is a pretty good span, considering other animals and rock stars. In the tern's lifetime, a human family household could see several pets come and go, each one just as tragic as the other to lose. There are graduations, silver anniversaries, a career studying through college for the doctorate.

So I guess it is fascinating to look at a specific age and consider what it means for different groups, see what those two groups experience in the same time frame. And three decades is important, a good indicator of changing environments and customs and borders and trends and technology and food habits. And the Arctic Tern gets to see many changing factors through a wide swath of land.

It is said a frog or toad is a good indicator of what is going on in specific region. The amphibians absorb water through the skin, meaning whatever is in the water gets into the body much faster than a human (get actual fact on this). This is good for one general region, a specific landscape to understand how that area might be changing.

This type of tern, though, could give a better idea of what is going on in the world through its lengthy flight pattern. It is no slouch and should be envied by the human ultra marathon runners, those women and men who choose to endeavor on 100 mile or more races for a few days, up and down valleys and mountain peaks.

For a yearly migration pattern, it glides across around 22,000 miles. Latest data form (link) shows terns leaving Maine (when?) to head south to Antarctica. And when it reaches the lonely continent, it will still travel east and west for food, flying up to another 14,000 miles in that time frame.

The researchers behind the tern like to say that, at the end of its life, the Arctic Tern could have gone to the Moon and back to Earth three times, or could make its way around the planet (how many times).

And in one day, during its migration, it might go 290 miles. A human walking an average pace along the Appalachian trail would need (how many days?).

Much of the time the tern is floating along wind currents over the Atlantic Ocean, but it makes its stops in Brazil, South Africa, Argentina. Each year they follow a similar pattern, either heading south along Africa or South America, then following the group back home between the two continents.
