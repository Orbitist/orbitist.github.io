There's nothing like sharing a map. For centuries people have gathered around and drawn lines in the sand, stood around tables, in board rooms, war rooms, living rooms-- observing, wondering, exploring via map. On the street they've looked together at maps in books, at bustops, on phones in the palms of their hands. On walls, on ships, in space and behind steering wheels -- people have shared maps. 

What's around the mountain, over the ocean, through the valley or sitting on mars? People have shown each other these things and fantasized about geographies. We go to some of those places, but not to them all. But maps let us experience them in a meanigful way.

And it's not just places-- it's us too. We often fail to look at ourselves objectively. Maps trump our vainness and let us see humanity from above. Maps are powerful-- they change minds.

Orbitist.com was built with the notion that important information should be made easy to consume and as relevant as possible. Our mission is to educate people by displaying the world in inspiring and epic ways. We do this with maps built on open source tools.

##Here's why our maps work

###The Lord of the Rings Effect:
If you've read the Lord of the rings, you know that all the places traveled to throughout the book can be hard to keep track of. However, Tolkien did an amazing thing: he added maps to the inside front cover of the books. These simple maps provide context throughout the tale and let readers follow along in a meaningful way.

Orbitist fully embraces the LOTR effect. Our stories guide readers through space and time by putting stories and maps side by side. On top of that, our story/map interactions make following along easy. Whether we're examining glaciers in New Zealand {% include cvi %}[-41.393, 177.473], 6{% include cvo %}, riding bikes through San Francisco {% include cvi %}[37.767, -122.361], 12{% include cvo %}, or updating you on the latest climate data {% include cvi %}[42.453, -79.27], 12{% include cvo %}

###Style:
Our stories are driven by narrative and conversational, laid-back writing. We aim for our stories to be pointed-- seek facts about the world and expressing truths in straight-forward, interesting ways. 

We explain the news by putting hyper-local stories into a global context. We take this further by putting users into that context and making them part of the narrative! 

###Sharing:
Humans are species of sharers-- it's why we've lasted as long as we have. People like to share what they discover and on Orbitist sharing is baked into the stories.

Our maps let people see their place in a story, capture the moment in a reflective view of yourself from above and push it to friends. Every time an Orbitist story is shared, value is added.
