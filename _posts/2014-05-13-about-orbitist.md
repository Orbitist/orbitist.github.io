**Our mission is to make important information as accessible and as easy to consume as possible. We do this by telling stories on maps.**

There's nothing like sharing a map. For centuries people have gathered around and drawn lines in the sand, stood around tables, in board rooms, war rooms, living rooms-- observing, wondering, exploring via map. On the street they've looked together at maps in books, at bus stops, on phones in the palms of their hands. On walls, on ships, in space and behind steering wheels -- people have shared maps. 

What's around the mountain, over the ocean, through the valley or sitting on mars? People have shown each other these things and fantasized about geographies. 

We go to some of these places, but not to them all. Yet maps let us experience them in a meaningful way.

And it's not just places-- it's us too. We often fail to look at ourselves objectively. Maps can trump our vainness and help us understand humanity through data. 

Maps are powerful-- they change our minds.

###The Lord of the Rings Effect:
Each book in J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy, The Lord of the Rings, has illustrated maps printed on their inside front covers. These maps are there as a reference to help the reader understand the many places visited throughout the books. The maps tell readers where they are and where they are going. They even offer extra detail about the world surrounding the story.

We aim to give users a similar experience, guiding them through space and time by putting stories and maps side by side. On top of that, our story/map interactions make following along easy. 

Perhaps we're looking at deforestation in Brazil {% include cvi %}[-10.124, -55.247], 11{% include cvo %}, bike-share locations in San Francisco {% include cvi %}[37.777, -122.422], 12{% include cvo %}, mountain biking in Fredonia, New York {% include cvi %}[42.45530187700012, -79.3387234210968], 17{% include cvo %}, or examining glaciers in New Zealand {% include cvi %}[-43.413, 170.343], 8{% include cvo %}. Whatever topic we cover, we're not just building beautiful maps; we're using maps as a medium to guide people through stories-- hopefully enriching their world view in the process.

###Style:
Our stories are driven by conversational, laid-back narrative through writing, photography, video, and audio. We aim to be pointed-- seeking facts about the world and expressing truths in straight-forward, interesting ways. 

Stories can be hyper-local or tell something about the world as a whole. They might be quick observation or long-form, in-depth pieces. Either way, we hope users see themselves in all of our maps and make a deeper connection than if the story were being told in a more typical fashion.

###Sharing:
Humans are a species of sharers-- it's why we've lasted as long as we have. 

Our maps let people see their place in stories. We think this makes our stories some of the most share-worthy content on the internet. Every time an Orbitist story is shared, value is added because everyone falls on a different part of the map and comes at the story from a different angle.

###Collaboration always beats competition:

We owe the sucess of this project to [so many amazing open source projects](https://github.com/Orbitist/orbitist.github.io/blob/master/README.md). There is absolutely no way our small team could have put the Orbitist together alone. That's why we're keeping [all of our code](https://github.com/Orbitist) open and available for anyone who wants to use it.

We make the internet a better place when we work together:)

###Learn, explore and share on!
We don't claim to know what we're doing at all! On the contrary, we're in this because no one fully understands what digital media means for storytelling. 

All we can say for sure is that it will fundamentally change the way people learn about the world around them! 

So please [tell us what we can be doing better](http://orbitist.com/pages/contact.html).
