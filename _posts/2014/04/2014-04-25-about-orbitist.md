Orbitist.com was build with the notion that important information should be made easy to consume and as relevant as possible. We do this with maps.

Here's why our maps work:

###The Lord of the Rings Effect:
Throughout the Lord of the rings, readers would be confused by all the place names. However, the author did an amazing thing-- he added maps to the inside cover of the books. These simple maps provide context throughout the tale and let readers follow along in a meaningful way.

Let's go to New Zealand: {% include cvi %}[-41.393, 177.473], 6{% include cvo %}

How about San Francisco: {% include cvi %}[37.767, -122.361], 12{% include cvo %}

Orbitist HQ: {% include cvi %}[42.453, -79.27], 12{% include cvo %}

###Sharing:
We're a species of sharers. People like to share what they discover and on Orbitist sharing is baked into the stories.

Our maps let people see their place in a story. You can capture that reflective view of yourself from above and push it to your friends, adding value in the process.
