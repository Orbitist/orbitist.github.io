The determination of the Underground Railroad (UGRR) operatives in western New York was greatly intensified by the plight of four refugees in particular: Joseph, Mary, and James Norton about 1844, and Harrison Williams in 1851. Furthermore, while the Norton case appears to have been an example of abolitionists taunting slaveholders, the Williams case was a clear example of slaveholders’ retribution.

Joseph Norton’s escape was relatively painless for him, but Mary Norton and Harrison Williams were made to suffer greatly for their attempts to flee bondage. Fortunately, the records suggest that all four persons finally enjoyed freedom.
