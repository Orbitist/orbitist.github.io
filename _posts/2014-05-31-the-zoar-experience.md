Traveling through the little village of Gowanda, NY you might miss the unmarked entrance. Explore further, and you are sure to think that you’ve discovered a secret geological treasure. Named by the first settlers to the area, they chose a name from the book of Genesis, Zoar, meaning “small” or “insignificant” in Hebrew - hardly an accurate description of Zoar Valley’s immense beauty. This little-known wonder is not just a hidden local gem of Western New York, it is said to be the best-kept secret of the northeast.

Some 3,000 acres of multiple-use wilderness, Zoar is as thick with rich beauty as the tops of its forest canopy. Hundred-year-old trees tower over the gorge as a result of careful preservation and a touch of fate in recent history.

The Holland Land Company originally owned the land in the early 1800s and logged-off much of the surrounding areas outside of the gorge. In those days, it was commonplace to float the fallen trees downstream. However, in forethought of chopping the trees, realized that dragging the monstrous timber to the water proved too difficult a feat and abandoned the mission, leaving some logs exactly where they fell.

Later, the Zoar area was safeguarded again when multiple power companies tried to harness the mighty creek but failed due to the weak shale foundation that surrounded it, making building nearly impossible. Continuing through history, there were plans to install a railroad on the land, in which those plans were also abandoned.  The land was then put up for sale and bought by the Darling family in the 1930s. They generously donated the land to the state for public use and admiration, which is still under the care of the New York State Department of Conservation today.

Overtime, the Cattaraugus Creek has created a landscape comprised of sheer cliffs, shale staircases and countless waterfalls, bringing along with it the shrouded mysteries of its existence.

If you’re lucky enough to know of it’s unique splendor, then you’re certainly a fortunate adventure-seeker. Zoar’s hidden gems keep even the most adventurous at the mercy of its unpredictable nature. Whitewater rafting, kayaking, canoeing, hiking, and fishing are among the most common activities that locals and travelers come yearning to experience while in Zoar Valley. Deerlick Conservation Area and Valentine Flats provide trails that guide hikers and bikers along the backcountry and up to scenic overlooks atop the cascading gorge.

The spring and early summer months bring forth pristine waters from rain and snowmelt runoff into Cattaraugus Creek, the largest tributary of the eastern end of Lake Erie. Along with it, Class II to Class IV rapids allow for various rafting outfitters to host guided trips down the creek’s raging waters. In fall months, the fast-moving creek beds swell with trout and steelhead.

The meandering Cattaraugus Creek is responsible for the carving of a 400-foot gorge, one of the most aesthetic formations in the region. So, as you stand at the top of the gorge looking out over its vastness, really take it all in. What you feel in that moment can only be referred to as - The Zoar Experience.
