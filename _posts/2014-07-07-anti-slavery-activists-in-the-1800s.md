This map is due to the hard work of Doug Shepard and Wendy Straight. They are super dedicated to compiling the most complete and accurate record of anti-slavery activists and Underground Railroad activities in Western New York and beyond.

This map reflects ever-expanding research based in Fredonia, NY {% include cvi %}[42.45164467991628, -79.33897018432617], 14{% include cvo %}.

According to Wendy:

"When conducting research into Chautauqua County’s Underground Railroad and America’s anti-slavery movement, one does not look for mythical tunnels, hidden rooms, or rings of trees.  Instead, the work is centered upon the people involved-- most of them native New Englanders and free African Americans. Together they built a vast and well populated network of activists, some working publically (above ground) and others behind the scenes (the “underground”). Some did both.

One major source for such research is the collection of Judge Elial T. Foote’s {% include cvi %}[42.096745671841, -79.235243790603], 17{% include cvo %} historical papers ([the Foote papers](http://www.mcclurgmuseum.org/collection/archives/elial_t_foote_papers/elial_t_foote_papers.html)). Although he lived in Chautauqua County for a very short time, he was a major player in the anti-slavery movement, and he kept lists of and correspondence from his colleagues in this county and elsewhere. 

Another source is the contributions list of Underground Railroad conductor Benjamin Vincent {% include cvi %}[42.348400000000, -79.135600000000], 17{% include cvo %}, who kept a file of his neighbors who had donated clothing for refugees.

Yet another source is the memoir of Underground Railroad conductor Eber Pettit {% include cvi %}[42.51880, -78.99240], 17{% include cvo %}, who named some nearby conductors and stationmasters. 

Still another source is a list of officers and committee leaders at local meetings of the anti-slavery society. 

The mission of this database is to place these people on the map, attempting to comprehend and honor their work. It is especially rewarding to find names that appear in more than one of the primary sources. An example is Benjamin Vincent {% include cvi %}[42.348400000000, -79.135600000000], 17{% include cvo %} himself, who also appears in the [Foote papers](http://www.mcclurgmuseum.org/collection/archives/elial_t_foote_papers/elial_t_foote_papers.html). Other examples are Rev. A. P. Hawley {% include cvi %}[42.5096366, -78.6671345], 17{% include cvo %}, Rev. S. G. Orton {% include cvi %}[42.285158211056, -79.670196168876], 17{% include cvo %}, C. O. Matthews {% include cvi %}[42.213325867096, -79.223613732314], 17{% include cvo %}, Thomas Danforth {% include cvi %}[42.313972768556, -79.541037075972], 17{% include cvo %}, Havens Brigham {% include cvi %}[42.446645372399, -79.334222667671], 17{% include cvo %}, and Abner Hazeltine {% include cvi %}[42.091773866383, -79.234814637160], 17{% include cvo %}, who all appear not only in [the Foote papers](http://www.mcclurgmuseum.org/collection/archives/elial_t_foote_papers/elial_t_foote_papers.html), but also in the published minutes of the county anti-slavery meeting of 1839."
