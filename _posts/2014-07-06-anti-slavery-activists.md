Clark R.\u2019s grandfather, Jeremiah \u003Cstrong\u003ELockwood\u003C\/strong\u003E, with his family, moved from Berkshire county, Mass., in the year 1810, to Schroon, where he remained until he died. At the time of this removal Jeremiah jr. was a lad of about thirteen years, his birth having occurred May 17th, 1797. His mother was born in Schroon in the year 1800, and died at their home June 22nd, 1850, and his father died at the residence of Charles \u003Cstrong\u003EFowler\u003C\/strong\u003E, in Chestertown, Warren county, N.Y., April 19th, 1869.

There he raised his family of children, and they were educated principally in the common schools of the town. He also had a small farm on which he resided, and which he carried on by the aid of his children. Hotel keeping, at that time and place, was more of an accommodation to the public than of benefit to the owner, and but small profit was derived therefrom.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cClark R. remained at home until about sixteen years old, when he engaged with Jonathan \u003Cstrong\u003EStevens\u003C\/strong\u003E, of Castleton, Vt., as an apprentice at wagon-making, but remained only about two years, when, because of illness, he abandoned the enterprise and returned to his home. For several months he remained there and recruited, and then attended select school in Ticonderoga, N.Y., for about six months, and subsequently in Poultney, Vt., for several months. Then for a short time he engaged in teaching, after which he went to Chambly, Canada, to acquire a knowledge of the French language, and there obtained a situation in a French family, from whom he received instruction, but remained only about eight months, on account of sickness in his father\u2019s family. Being now about twenty-one years of age he again felt the necessity of choosing a business for life. He had no means except the little acquired from teaching. His health was poor, though improving, but, fully resolved upon making a \u201cstrike,\u201d he, through the assistance of Mr. A. R. \u003Cstrong\u003ECatlin\u003C\/strong\u003E, an old friend residing in Jamestown, obtained a situation as student in the law office of Mr. Orsell \u003Cstrong\u003ECook\u003C\/strong\u003E, a leading lawyer in western New York.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cHe taught school during the winter of 1848-49 and with the wages thus earned he paid a few debts, bought a small amount of clothing, and with the remainder, less than $20, he left his home about August 23d, 1849, for the office of Mr. \u003Cstrong\u003ECook\u003C\/strong\u003E in Jamestown, where he commenced reading \u003Cem\u003EBlackstone\u003C\/em\u003E.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cFor a time he resided in the family of Mr. \u003Cstrong\u003ECook\u003C\/strong\u003E, doing chores to pay his board, but finding it necessary to replenish his funds, he engaged in teaching in the old \u201cPine street school-house\u201d for the term of six months, and during that time wrote for the office, boarded himself, and kept up his law reading. In the fall and winter of 1852-53 he attended the \u003Cstrong\u003EFowler\u003C\/strong\u003E Law School, at Ballston Spa, N.Y., and in the spring of 1853 was admitted to practice at a General Term of the Supreme Court, held at Buffalo.

After his marriage he returned to the office of Mr. \u003Cstrong\u003ECook\u003C\/strong\u003E, and, after a few months, formed a law partnership with Mr. W. M. \u003Cstrong\u003ENewton\u003C\/strong\u003E, with whom he continued practicing his profession under the name of \u003Cstrong\u003ELockwood\u003C\/strong\u003E \u0026amp; \u003Cstrong\u003ENewton\u003C\/strong\u003E down to about August 25th, 1855, at which time he and Mr. \u003Cstrong\u003ECook\u003C\/strong\u003E entered into partnership under the firm name of \u003Cstrong\u003ECook\u003C\/strong\u003E \u0026amp; \u003Cstrong\u003ELockwood\u003C\/strong\u003E.

In politics he was reared a Democrat, but as time advanced and party agitation developed the evils of slavery he felt it his duty to, and did, follow the leading thought of the country in protesting against slavery\u2019s assumed right of extension. He aided in the formation of the Republican party of his county, the fundamental principles of which he has ever cherished, and with the advocates of which he is yet identified. Although an active worker for the promotion of his principles he has not been an office seeker. In religious convictions he is a Universalist, liberal in thought and tolerant toward others. He has two children living, Olive Amanda, wife of Abner E. \u003Cstrong\u003EAllen\u003C\/strong\u003E, and Clark Wheeler [\u003Cstrong\u003ELockwood\u003C\/strong\u003E]. A daughter, Lizzie W., died several years since.

This society it was apparent had done much good in lessening the evils of intemperance and abolishing the hitherto almost universal custom of using ardent spirits in the domestic and social circle; but it was apparent that much remained yet to be done to gain a complete victory over this monster vice. The absurdity of the license system was brought under especial notice, and a resolution adopted to use all laudable means to have amended or done away a law granting a \u003Cem\u003Ebounty\u003C\/em\u003E for the sale of ardent spirits\u2014a law that would disgrace even the dark ages.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cThe several objects of these different societies having been passed upon during the day and evening of Wednesday, on Thursday an interesting exhibition of the scholars and teachers of the Sabbath Schools of Westfield and those in its immediate vicinity took place; an exhibition well arranged and executed, with the single fault (and a fault altogether too common) of keeping the children, after marching, in a standing position for an hour or more to hear addresses.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cThe ceremonies were closed by a discourse in the evening upon the subject of anti-slavery, by the Rev.

Hedley, Ed., American Historical Society, 1921. \u201cThe Blodgett family left a deep impress upon the history of Busti. The founder, Arba Blodgett, a soldier of the War of 1812, settled in the town near the State line in the southwestern part soon after his military service ended \u2026. He was a strong Abolitionist, and tradition says his home was a station on the Underground Railroad. Loren Blodgett, son of Arba, was known throughout the United States as a statistician, economist and journalist; and his works connected with the Smithsonian Institution and Treasury Department won for him a reputation as one of the world\u0027s greatest statistical compilers\u2026. Arba died in Busti in 1837, meeting an accidental death. Near the Blodgetts lived the family of William Storum, colored, whose daughter married Lewis Clark, a fugitive slave from whose life Harriet Beecher Stowe drew the character of George Harris for \u003Cem\u003EUncle Tom\u0027s Cabin\u003C\/em\u003E. A granddaughter of William Storum married a son of Frederick Douglass. This Storum home was the scene of a cruel incident in 1851, when a runaway slave from the South was taken from there and returned to his old masters.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EArba Blodgett was born in Massachusetts in 1789. In December 1811, he married Reba (Bebe) Bullock, who was born there in 1790. In May 1814 they took a land contract for property in Busti NY, as did William Bullock in October 1814 and Cyrenus Blodgett in June 1815. The two sons, William Oren Blodgett and Lorin Blodgett, seem to have followed their father\u2019s footsteps in the anti-slavery movement. The five daughters, at least some of whom were also active in the anti-slavery cause, were Lucinda Blodgett Langdon (1813-1873), Clarissa M. Blodgett (1816-1887), Adelia Blodgett Smith (1819-1850), Sylvia Blodgett (1827-1849), and Loice (Lois) Blodgett Lott (1829-1915). Bebe later married a widower, Joshua Van Deusen (VanDusen). They were living in the Town of Ellicott at the time of the 1850 Census. She died in Philadelphia in 1878.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.2873,42.0442]},"properties":{"name":"Backus","description":"\u003Cp\u003ENorman Backus was born in Onondaga County around 1800 according to his own statements to various census takers. Although his name does not appear in Onondaga records, there are many Backus families there from an early date. The earliest record for him is probably the Norman Backus in Salisbury, Herkimer County in the 1830 Census. His wife, Charlotte, was from Herkimer County. By 1840 they had relocated to Clymer NY. Their daughter, Emily, was born in Chautauqua County in 1839. He is not found in the 1850 Census, but by 1855 they were in Busti, where he worked as a cooper. He, his wife, and Emily had been in Busti for 15 years, and their son William had been born there in 1844. The 1860 Census finds him farming in Clymer, but back in Busti as a cooper again in 1865. In 1870 he is listed in Busti as a farm laborer. He and Charlotte probably died soon after that. In 1875 William is found living with his married sister, Caroline, and her husband William Seaver, with no other Backus names in the record. Norman\u2019s anti-slavery activity was cited in the \u003Cem\u003EJamestown Morning Post\u003C\/em\u003E of 18 July 1923 in a reprint of Palmer K. Shankland\u2019s 1891 article from the 18 July 1891 \u003Cem\u003ESaturday Times\u003C\/em\u003E. Although Backus cannot be seen on the 1854 county wall map, several of his neighbors from the 1855 census would place him in or just north of the hamlet of Busti Corners at that time.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.6297,42.0086]},"properties":{"name":"Amidon","description":"\u003Cp\u003ERev. John Amidon was cited as an Underground Railroad stationmaster by descendants, who contacted\u00a0 the Chautauqua County historian after they found unpublished family records in 2012. John Smith Amidon was born on 2 September 1821 to Leonard and Esther (Smith) Amidon, originally from Connecticut. The family must have removed to NY State fairly early, since John Amidon gave his birth place as Onondaga NY. Young\u2019s \u003Cem\u003EHistory of Chautauqua County\u003C\/em\u003E, p.295, notes that Leonard Amidon contracted for or bought Lot 52 in Twp.1, Range 14, in January 1823. The first local record for Leonard Amidon (sometimes given as Amadon) is in the 1840 Census for Clymer NY. The Methodist Episcopal Church in Clymer organized around 1825. The first class included Lawrence and Adelia Amidon, Elijah and Sarah Amidon, and Leonard and Esther Amidon. When John S. Amidon joined the Methodist Episcopal Church and became a minister is not recorded. He married Charlotte A. Curtis, originally from Madison NY, probably around 1842. Their eldest son, John N., was born in PA in 1845; daughter Apphia in 1851; and William E. in 1854, so John Amidon may have had his early ministry there. Census records for 1855, 1860 and 1870 consistently list him as a farmer. One unverified report, said to be from family records, notes that he operated an Underground Railroad station on the Corry-Clymer Road as well as manning the toll house on what was the Westfield Clymer Plank Road. The toll house can be seen on the 1854 wall map near the L. Amidon farm.\u00a0 Comparing the following homeowners\u2019 family names from the section of the 1855 Census that includes three Amidon households with the names on the 1854 map gives a reasonably accurate location for the home of John S. Amidon that may have been the Underground Railroad station. John S. Amidon died in Corry PA on 3 October 1898.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n"}}]}"
