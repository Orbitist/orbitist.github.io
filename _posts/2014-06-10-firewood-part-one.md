_ When that fat old sun in the sky is falling,
Summer evening birds are calling.
Summer's thunder time of year,
The sound of music in my ears.
~David Gilmour_

It’s a brilliantly clear summer evening, the steadily deepening azure sky speckled with cotton-white cloud tufts. The final rays of a sweltering day are throwing long, cool shadows onto the surrounding ground.

Maybe you’re a few days into a hiking trek through the dense Allegheny Forest, home to more oil and gas wells than any other state-managed forest in the country. Or, perhaps the breathing wash of waves is all but covering the laughter of  you and your company as you sink your feet into the cool, damp sand of a remote beach. Rather still, you may be in the comfort of your own backyard, sinking into a muddy folding chair--feet up, brew in hand.

Regardless, the first chill of the evening, and no shortage of insects are settling around you as the sunlight fades. But there is no need to stay in discomfort, as you have a classic tool at your disposal: the knowledge and experience which grasped and yanked humanity by the hair--straight out of the Paleolithic hundreds of thousands of years ago; the ‘mastery’ of fire.

You reach behind your seat, wrap cold fingers around a recently gathered branch, turn and toss it into the eager flames that are your cardinal tool, guardian and source of comfort in the outdoors. It certainly seems that most everyone with which one speaks has had an experience (or several) to share--tales of gathering around these lit logs, which happily pop and snap; warding away the irrational fears which manifest in the eerie night (and substituting your own, of course, with wonderfully entertaining ghost stories). I remember delaying the inevitable act of washing my jacket for as long as I could shield my mother’s cleaning instincts, the better to retain that thick, musky, reminiscent smell. One is warmed by a campfire inside and out, as it is mesmerizingly animated, a garish delight. Friends and family join together in time-honored tradition, without glowing screens with with to distract oneself. No tragedies, primetime or politics; just (usually, hopefully and preferably) good company. 

As you place a log into the hungry flames, you probably don’t spend any time considering where the source tree grew and was felled. Most likely, you’re also not pondering the (possibly dangerous) foreign organisms harbored within your biofuel. 50 million trees have been killed since 2002 by a single, wood-hitchhiking species of beetle--a dangerously invasive creature.What is living in your lumber? 

Around the heated hearth, you might toast a marshmallow or roast a carefully cut spider-dog (as my family calls them), but chances are--unless you’re traveling in a remote region--if the fire (knock on logs) goes out, or you run out of burnables, one can generally scavenge for additional fuel, buy a slightly expensive bundle of kiln-dried (read, ridiculously flammable) wood, or just go without, if it’s too much trouble. Maybe you’ll just walk abashedly back to into your nearby home and throw a pack of sodium-enriched Ramen in the microwave. But in many areas of the world, this simply isn’t an option. Around three billion people worldwide cook and heat their homes using open fires and simple stoves burning biomass. And over four million people (8 per minute) perish each year from illnesses related to household air pollution, created from cooking with solid fuels. To put it in perspective: a fire in the kitchen, if you’re cooking a meal, produces about the same pollution per hour in a typical house as a thousand cigarettes burning. In many regions, woodfuel is more scarce and valuable than the food for which it is burned.

This series, length yet unknown, will explore the human assisted movement of firewood, and the hugely significant environmental impacts of this commonplace activity. You’ll meet the Emerald Ash Bore and the Asian Longhorn Beetle--two very dangerous, diligent immigrants. We’ll visit incredibly interesting faraway countries, and share the boggling story of how a ten dollar cookstove is saving the world, one carbon-credited sale at a time.

These are not the topics which one usually thinks about, as you feed your hungry friend called fire, one branch at a time. But you’ll be amazed at the places these narratives take us, in the exploratory story engine that is the Orbitist.
