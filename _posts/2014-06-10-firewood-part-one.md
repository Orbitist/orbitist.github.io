description: An exploration into a classic biofuel

>_When that fat old sun in the sky is falling,  
Summer evening birds are calling.  
Summer's thunder time of year,  
The sound of music in my ears.  
~David Gilmour_  


**It’s a brilliantly clear summer evening**, the deepening azure sky specked with cotton-white tufts of cloud. The final rays of a sweltering day throw long, cool shadows onto the surrounding ground.

Maybe you’re a few days into a hiking trek through the dense Allegheny Forest {% include cvi %}[41.745, -78.42], 8{% include cvo %}, home to more than 8,000 active oil and gas wells--more than all wells collectively within the other 154 national forests. 

Or perhaps you're dipping your toes into the cool, damp sand of a calm beach-- why not 90 Mile Beach in the North Island of New Zealand? {% include cvi %}[-35.851, 175.397], 8{% include cvo %} It's actually only 55 miles long; a gross miscalculation made by early missionaries who reckoned horses to travel 30 miles a day, failing to observe that horses walk much more slowly in sand. 

Rather, you might be in the comfort of your own backyard {% include cvi %}[42.44, -79.327], 17{% include cvo %} sinking into a mud-splattered folding chair--feet up, brew in hand.

Wherever you may be, the sun is setting and the first chill of night is settling around you. There is no mistaking the buzzing whine of stinging insects flitting about, searching for bare skin. Life outdoors seems like it's about to get much more uncomfortable. 

But, you have a classic tool at your disposal: the knowledge and experience that grasped and yanked humanity by the hair, straight out of the Paleolithic era hundreds of thousands of years ago. The ‘mastery’ of fire.

You reach behind your seat and wrap cold fingers around a recently gathered branch, turn and toss it into the flickering flames that are your cardinal tool, guardian and source of comfort in the outdoors. 

It seems that everyone has one or many stories to tell--of gathering around these lit logs which happily pop and snap. The flames drive away our fear of the dark and of the things that go bump in the night. Of course, we often substitute our own horror, ("tell us that same ghost story for the 18th time, Dad").

When I'd return from a camping trip, I would hide my (probably filthy) coat from my mom--knowing that she'd try and clean it. But washing away that musky, reminiscient campfire smell was the worst sin I could imagine. 

You're warmed by a campfire inside and out. Family and friends gathering together in a time honored tradition without glowing screens to distract yourself. No tragedies, primetime or politics--just usually, hopefully and preferably, good company. 

{% include cvi %}[42.55, -78.574], 9{% include cvo %}

As you place a log into your hungry fire, you probably don’t spend any time thinking about where the source tree grew and was felled. You’re also probably not considering the (possibly dangerous) foreign organisms harbored within your biofuel. 50 million trees have been killed since 2002 by a single, wood-hitchhiking species of beetle--a dangerously invasive creature. 

What is living in your lumber? 

Around the heated hearth, you might toast a marshmallow or roast a carefully cut spider-dog (as my family calls them), but chances are--unless you’re traveling in a remote area--if the fire goes out, you can probably just scavenge for more wood or buy an expensive kiln-dried bundle. Or, you could just go without, if it’s too much trouble. 

Maybe you’ll just walk shamefully back to your house and throw a pack of sodium-enriched Ramen in the microwave. But in many areas of the world, this simply isn’t an option. Surprisingly, in many regions, woodfuel is more scarce (and consquentially more valuable) than the food it's used to cook.

{% include cvi %}[39.775, 104.414], 2{% include cvo %} 

Around three billion people worldwide cook and heat their homes using open fires and simple stoves burning biomass. And over four million people (8 per minute) die each year from illnesses related to indoor air pollution. 

To put it in perspective, if you’re cooking a meal with an indoor fire, it produces about the same pollution per hour as a _thousand_ cigarettes burning. 

This series will explore the human assisted movement of firewood and the environmental impact of this common activity. We'll meet the Emerald Ash Bore and the Asian Longhorn Beetle--two dangerous, diligent immigrants.

We’ll visit incredibly interesting and faraway countries, and share the boggling story of how a ten dollar cookstove is saving the world, one carbon-credited sale at a time.

To be continued, in Part One--_Meet the Beetles?_
